## Assests contribution

As repository grows it is immposible to make all the Assests/Elements by myself so i used some websites. Some of them don't require credit but most of them does. So as a good gesture I thought to include all the credits regardless of their credit policy.


1. [Uiverse](https://uiverse.io) - The Largest Library of Open-Source UI (Claim by Uiverse)
2. [Flaticon](https://flaticon.com) Some Assests are Designed by Freepik from Flaticon - The most wanted free SVG user interface icons (Claim by Flaticon)
